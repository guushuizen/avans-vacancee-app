# Vacancee POC

This project is built to demonstrate basic functionality of an application I'm building for the course of Front-end design and development at Avans Hogeschool.

### Functionalities

At the time of writing this, this repo contains code that allows a user to register an account, receive an e-mail containing a verification code (using MailJet) and enter that verification code to verify his account.

I might have gone a little over the top with this by writing abstract functionality to insert, update and retrieve models from a MySQL database - as a foundation for later models introduced in this project.

### Documentation

See attached files in the `docs` folder for information on the assignment, but also the reports I wrote that go along with this proof-of-concept.
